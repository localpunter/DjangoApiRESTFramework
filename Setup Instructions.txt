ALL THE BELOW ACTIONS ARE PERFORMED IN THE TERMINAL!

1. Create a directory and navigate into it: (Either in explorer (new folder) or in terminal)
'mkdir <name>' then cd <name>

2. Set up a virtual environment: (this allows you to create many environments that run independantly)
'python -m venv <environment name>'

3. Navigate to the Scripts folder:
'cd <environment name>' then 'cd Scripts'

4. Activate the virtual environment: (this will show the environment name before the path - (envName) C:\etc\etc.)
'activate' - ('deactivate' undoes this)

5. Now come back 2 levels:
'cd ..' and 'cd ..'

6. Install Django: (this will install the lastest version in your environment)
pip install django

7. Update pip: (if there is a newer version you will be notified)
pip install --upgrade pip

8. Now create the Django project: (adding the ' .' at the end saves another folder being created with the same name)
'django-admin startproject <project name .>'

9. Now start the app. Call <name> what you want and then add to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
'python manage.py startapp <name>'

10. Create a SQL database:
'python manage.py migrate'

11. Create a superuser for the login credentials: (This asks for Username, Email & Pw. Username & Pw are all you need)
'python manage.py createsuperuser'

12. Start running the server: (you will see a lot of info including 'Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/'. This is the address of the server)
'python manage.py runserver'
